Opinio, as the name suggests is a web-based application to conduct polls, collect survey and moreover to gather opinion of large number of people. After the user sign's in, the poll is completely anonymous only collecting the information that whether a user has voted or not.

Any user can create a survey or poll, with a flexibility of creating as many as options as he/she wants. A user can make the survey public, so that more number of people can join in, or can send it to particular set of people.

As the backend, this application uses Mongo-db with node.js to connect to the database. The database collects and stores the number of votes per option neglecting the user who has voted. It also stores the number of people using the application and their user details.

As a front end, HTML, CSS, and javascript has been used.
